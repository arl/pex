This is a list of things I would like to do (or see done).

If you want to do something not on this list, and want it upstreamed, please discuss it first.

In no particular order:

- ability to write a column to a file
- debounce keystrokes
- allow dynamic adjustment of max column (or min column width?)
- maybe add column titles (what? number? command?)
- better way to focus first column
- option to only execute when user hits enter
- way to hide columns?
- jq parser so we can treat a jq pipeline the same as a shell pipeline (hard)
- safe mode (execute subprocess in a sandbox)
- toggle line numbers (per column? globally?)
- display number of lines (?)
- toggle word wrap (vs truncate) (per column? globally?)
- need to strip escape codes?
- support env vars?
